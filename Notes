Types of Data
categorical and numerical

categorical --
nominal and ordinal

nominal data is a classification of categorical variable that do not provide any quantitative value

ordinal data is the type of data in which the values follow a natural order

numerical---
discrete data is the type of data that can only take certain values

continuous data is the type


statistics-->
descriptive and inferential

descriptive- this type of stats are used to describe the basic features of the data in a study the provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures

1.describes the data
2.used for analysis

important measures in descriptive stats
1.measure of central tendencies
2.measure of variability(range,S.Dv,variance)

inferential-takes data frn a sample and makes inferences and predictions about the larger population from which the sample was taken
1.gets inferences about the data
2



TYPES OF STATISTICAL STUDIES

SAMPLE-- a sample study is a study which is carried out on a sample which represents the total population.

OBSERVATIONAL-it is a study where we simply collect data and analyze it we wont inject any changes we just observe the correlation

EXPERIMENTAL-a study in which conditions are controlled and manipulated by the experimenter


POPULATION AND SAMPLE---->

SAMPLING TECHNIQUES
1.Simple Random Sampling
2.Systematic Sampling
3.Stratified Random Sampling
4.Cluster Sampling

these are called probability sampling techniques

Simple Random Sampling- in this the sample is randomly picked from a larger population .hence,all the individual datapoints has an equal probably to be selected sample data.

Eg-a employee survey in a company

Pros
1.No sample bias
2.Balanced Sample
3.Simple Method of Sampling
4.Requires less domain knowledge

Cons
1. Population Size should High
2. Cannot represent the population well sometimes


SYSTEMATIC SAMPLING--->
the sample is picked from the population at regular intervals. this type of sampling is carried out if the population is homogeneous and the data points are uniformly distributed

Example-- Selecting every 10th member from a population of 10,000


STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLING---
the population is subdivided into smaller groups called "strata". samples are obtained randomly from all these strata

eg- selecting data of smartphones sold in all the states of india

CLUSTER SAMPLING---> its carried out on population that has inherent groups. This population is subdivided into clusters and the random clusters are taken as sample

Example- Smartphone sales are taken from only selected state which represent g




PERCENTILE VS QUANTILES


PERCENTILE- is a value on a scale of 100 that indicates the percent of a distribution that is equal to or below it.

QUANTILE- is a measure that tells how many values in a dataset are above or below is a certain limit. it divides the members of the dataset into equally sized groups


Correlation- is a measure which determines the extent to which two variables are related to each other in a data set but this doesnt mean that one event is the cause of the other event
 --positive correlation means if one increases other value also increase and vice versa is negative correlation


Causation- In stats causation means that one event causes another event to occur. Thus,there is a cause and effect relationship between the two variables in a dataset.



HYPOTHESIS TESTING


hypothesis is an assumption that is made based on the observations of an experiment

2 types of it-
Null hypothesis- is the commonly accepted fact (h<sub>0<sub>)
Alternative Hypothesis(H<sub>a<sub>) is the opposite to null hypothesis and it challenges the null hypothesis

hypothesis testing is a method carried out to test the assumptions made in the experiment
