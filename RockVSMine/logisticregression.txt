Logistic regression is a type of regression analysis used for predicting the probability of a categorical dependent variable. It's commonly used for binary classification problems, where the target variable has only two possible outcomes (e.g., 0 or 1, yes or no, true or false).

In logistic regression, the output is transformed using the logistic function (also known as the sigmoid function) to ensure that the predicted values lie between 0 and 1, representing probabilities.

Here's a simple explanation with a small example:

Suppose we want to predict whether a student will pass or fail an exam based on the number of hours they study. We have data for several students where we know the number of hours they studied and whether they passed (1) or failed (0) the exam. We can use logistic regression to build a model for this prediction.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data: Hours studied and exam outcome (Pass/Fail)
hours_studied = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]).reshape(-1, 1)  # Feature
exam_outcome = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])  # Target (0: Fail, 1: Pass)

# Create and fit the logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(hours_studied, exam_outcome)

# Plot the logistic regression curve
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(hours_studied, exam_outcome, color='black')
plt.plot(hours_studied, model.predict_proba(hours_studied)[:, 1], color='blue', linewidth=3)
plt.xlabel('Hours Studied')
plt.ylabel('Probability of Passing Exam')
plt.title('Logistic Regression')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

In this example, we first import necessary libraries including `numpy` for numerical computations, `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` for logistic regression, and `matplotlib.pyplot` for visualization. We then create some sample data where `hours_studied` represents the feature (independent variable) and `exam_outcome` represents the target (dependent variable).

Next, we create and fit a logistic regression model using the `LogisticRegression` class from scikit-learn. After fitting the model, we plot the logistic regression curve to visualize how the probability of passing the exam changes with the number of hours studied.

This example demonstrates a simple use case of logistic regression for binary classification, where we predict the probability of passing an exam based on the number of hours studied.
